## Explanation
Genius was a very popular game in the 80's, that seeks to stimulate memoryzing of color and sounds. It had colored buttons that emitted sounds and lit up in sequence. The player had to hit  the correct sequence.  

## Rules
- You need to click on the colors to formulate the same sequence given at the beggining of each turn.

## How to Play
- Click on power button to turn on the board.
- Click on start to play.
- If you want to reset, click on power to turn off and click on power again to turn on again, after that click on start.
- When you miss a sequence, the board will shake and the last sequence will be repeated.

**Theres two levels:** 
- When STRICT is turned on, you can't go wrong even once. 
- When STRICT is turned of, if your wrong the board will repeat the last sequence.
